////	- Explain the Java-based MVC architecture in Web application development.
//		
//	1>MVC is a systematic way to use the application where the flow starts from the view
//	layer, where the request is raised and processed in controller layer and sent to model
//	layer to insert data and get back the success or failure message.
//	
//	2>This is the data layer which consists of the business logic of the system.
//	
//	Model Layer>-
	
//	It consists of all the data of the application
//	
//	It also represents the state of the application.
//	
//	It consists of classes which have the connection to the database.
//	
//	The controller connects with model and fetches the data and sends to the view
//	layer.
//	
//	The model connects with the database as well and stores the data into a database
//	which is connected to it.
//	
//	View Layer>--
//	
//
//	
//	This is a presentation layer.
//	
//	It consists of HTML, JSP, etc. into it.
//	
//	It normally presents the UI of the application.
//	
//	It is used to display the data which is fetched from the controller which in turn
//	fetching data from model layer classes.
//	
//	Controller Layer>--
//	
//	It acts as an interface between View and Model.
//	
//	It intercepts all the requests which are coming from the view layer.
//	
//	It receives the requests from the view layer and processes the requests and does
//	the necessary validation for the request.
