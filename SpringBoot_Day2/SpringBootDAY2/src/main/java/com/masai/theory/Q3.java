//		
//	SOAP
	
//	1>--it is a xml based protocol, to communicate bt client application to the server application, 
//	since it is xml based , it is also platform and language independent.
//	
//	2>WSDL file (it is also an xml file in which we describe all the services which we expose to the client)
//
//	REST 
//	
//	1>--This REST architectural style tells that create a Web Services with the required operations/functionalities 
//	and expose them through the Http protocol . and allow them to be accessed by the client with 
//	the help of Http protocol without any extra binding classes and any xml files.
//	
//	2>--in restfull ws, A WS class is called as "rootresource" class and each method (service) of that class
//	is called as "resource".
